## What are Distributed Systems?

A collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system. Before diving deep into what distributed systems really are and how they are interconnected, it will be useful to consider some key differences between what distribution, or decentralization actually entails.

### Distributed Vs. Decentralized Systems

It's critical to ask yourself the question that how these computers even became connected to each other in the first place? There are two approaches to think of when distinguishing between distributed and decentralized systems.

- Integrative View
- Expansive View

**Integrative View:** Connect *existing* networked computer systems to each other. This happens when you want to make services running on a single system need to be made available to more users.

**Expansive View:** An existing system is made stronger by an extension via additional computers.
