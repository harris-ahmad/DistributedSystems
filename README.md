# DistributedSystems

Notes that I took while reading the book "Designing Data Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann. 

**Note:** I'm drafting these notes after having taken and passed distributed systems in the Fall 2022 semester. I'm reviewing the course again, so I might not provide concrete definitions for basic networking concepts.
